Print the longest common substring

Given two strings ‘X’ and ‘Y’, print the length of the longest common substring. If two or more substrings have the same value 
for longest common substring, then print any one of them.

Examples:

Input :  X = "GeeksforGeeks", 
         Y = "GeeksQuiz"
Output : Geeks

Input : X = "zxabcdezy", 
        Y = "yzabcdezx"
Output : abcdez
