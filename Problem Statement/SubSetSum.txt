Subset Sum Problem:

Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum.
Example:

Input: set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 9
Output: True  
There is a subset (4, 5) with sum 9.

Input: set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 30
Output: False
There is no subset that add up to 30.
