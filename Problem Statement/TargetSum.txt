Problem Statement :
Given: An array with elements and a target sum we are to achieve
Conditions:

We are allowed to either add or subtract elements with one another
Can use + or â€“ with the existing sum to achieve our target.

Output : 
The number of ways in which we can reach the target

example :
arr[1,1,2,3] targetsum = 1
Solution:
1. (+1-1-2+3)  = 1
2. (-1+1-2+3)  = 1
3. (+1+1+2-3)  = 1

so Output will be 3.
The number of ways in which we can reach the target
