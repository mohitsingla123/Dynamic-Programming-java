Minimum number of deletions and insertions to transform one string into another

Given two strings ‘str1’ and ‘str2’ of size m and n respectively. The task is to remove/delete and insert minimum number of characters from
str1 so as to transform it into str2. It could be possible that the same character needs to be removed/deleted from one point of str1 and inserted to some another point.

Examples:

Input : str1 = "heap", str2 = "pea" 
Output : Minimum Deletion = 2 and
         Minimum Insertion = 1
p and h deleted from heap
Then, p is inserted at the beginning
One thing to note, though p was required yet
it was removed/deleted first from its position and
then it is inserted to some other position.
Thus, p contributes one to the deletion_count
and one to the insertion_count.

Input : str1 = "geeksforgeeks", str2 = "geeks"
Output : Minimum Deletion = 8
         Minimum Insertion = 0
